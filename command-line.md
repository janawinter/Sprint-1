The Commandline is a place where you type out  messages to the inner brain of your computer to make it do things, like create a new folder, search for files, or move them around.You use the commandline instead of moving your mouse around and clicking things.
The Commandline communicates in text only,so you type in your commands you want to do.
It is also stickler for errors, so if you miss one character or add an extra space, it will not co-operate and throw a tanrum! When used properly it is a handy tool to navigate around your computer.
